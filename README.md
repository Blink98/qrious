### The project is live at:

https://qrious-web.herokuapp.com/

### Workflow:

1. Make sure you have MetaMask installed.
2. Create an account on MetaMask on **Polygon Mumbai** network and add tokens to it using https://faucet.polygon.technology/.
3. Now connect the account to our app and fill the details.
4. Once you hit submit our app will establish a connection with a Smart Contract (this contract is already deployed on Polygon Blockchain) and save the data to the blockchain.
5. After confirming that the data has been successfully saved, it will generate a unique QR code for your product.
